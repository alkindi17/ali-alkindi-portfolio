Inspired by the growing impact of large language models across industries, I developed an AI-powered chat application that showcases both my technical skills and my fascination with conversational AI. This project emerged from my desire to gain hands-on experience with LLMs while creating something practical and engaging.

The core concept was to create an interactive platform where users can have natural conversations with an AI trained to represent my professional identity. Through thoughtful dialogue, visitors can learn about my technical background, projects, and experiences in a dynamic, personalized way.
