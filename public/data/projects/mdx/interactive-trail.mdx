## Description

In response to the Newport City Council's request to replace traditional trail leaflets, our team of four students developed a web app. Beyond simply fulfilling this requirement, we integrated features to promote walking in an interactive, game-like manner. Users can earn points by discovering new locations. They can also scan the QR codes on the landmarks along the trails to get additional information about it. Furthermore, the app features a dedicated section for walking events and includes an admin page for seamless website management.

## App Features

- **Clean UI:** Adhering to the branding guidelines of the Newport City Council.
- **Home Page:** Provides information on upcoming events, quick links to different trail levels, and easy access to the QR code scanner.

- **Admin Access:** Allows administrators to add, edit, and delete trails, events, and landmarks, providing efficient management of app content.
