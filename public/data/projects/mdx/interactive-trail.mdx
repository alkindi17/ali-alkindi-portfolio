## Project Description

The project team, consisting of developers, designers, and project managers, collaborates using GitLab for version control and project management. Following Agile principles, the team employs Scrum methodology to ensure iterative development and quick adaptability to stakeholder feedback.

The project begins with comprehensive requirements gathering and analysis, including consultations with Newport City Council representatives to understand their vision and objectives for the interactive trail. Once the requirements are defined, the team proceeds with architectural design and planning, outlining the system's structure, functionality, and user interface.

Development kicks off with the backend implementation using Python and Flask to create the application's logic and API endpoints. Concurrently, frontend developers work on crafting the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, focusing on responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing across various devices and screen sizes.

A key component of the project involves integrating SQLite for database management, enabling the storage and retrieval of attraction data, user feedback, and other relevant information. The database schema is carefully designed to accommodate the application's requirements and facilitate efficient data management.

Throughout the development process, continuous testing is conducted to identify and address any bugs or issues promptly. Automated testing frameworks are utilized to streamline the testing process and ensure the application's reliability and stability.

Once the core features are implemented, the application undergoes rigorous quality assurance testing to verify its functionality, usability, and performance. User acceptance testing (UAT) is also conducted to gather feedback from target users and validate the application's suitability for its intended audience.

Upon successful completion of testing and refinement, the Interactive Trail Web Application is deployed to a production environment, ready for public access. Post-deployment, the team continues to monitor the application's performance, address any reported issues, and implement enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

## Goals

- Develop a mobile web app that provides an interactive trail experience of Newport City attractions.
- Implement a user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and engaging content.
- Ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Incorporate features for users to explore attractions, access additional information, and provide feedback.

## Conclusion

The Interactive Trail Web Application project endeavors to enrich the visitor experience in Newport City by offering a dynamic and informative platform for exploring its attractions. Through collaborative development and the use of modern technologies, the project aims to deliver a high-quality mobile web app that meets the requirements set forth by the Newport City Council.
