## Description

In response to the growing challenge faced by BipSync's HR Department in managing the increasing number of employee onboarding processes, we developed a tailored web application solution. This platform empowers HR department personnel to efficiently oversee all aspects of the onboarding process, assigning specific tasks to various company departments for seamless collaboration. For instance, tasks such as preparing a laptop for an incoming employee can be delegated to the IT department. The status of these tasks is visualized through a Kanban board, providing clear visibility and progress tracking.

## App Features

- **Secure Access:** Ensured security through a secure login page and user registration managed by administrators only.
- **Privacy Controls:** Employees accessing the platform are restricted to viewing only relevant information. For instance, sensitive details like bank account information are visible only to HR and Admin personnel.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Streamlined processes for adding, editing, and deleting employee onboarding records and tasks, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.
- **Tasks Library:** Enhanced efficiency with the ability to add groups of tasks under each employee onboarding record, simplifying management.
- **Email Reminders:** Whenever a task is added, an email is sent to the assignee, and a reminder is sent daily until the task is completed.
- **Kanban Board:** Intuitive task tracking via a Kanban board, facilitating easy monitoring of task progress.

## Skills Gained

Throughout this project,I have gained many personal and technical skills.

Working collaboratively in a group of four, adhering to agile methodology, provided invaluable experience. Rotating the role of scrum master weekly taught me effective leadership and teamwork skills through leading meetings and the ability to guide others by helping them with their issues. However, even when I was not the scrum master, I made proactive efforts to ensure the seamless progression of the project. I consistently communicated with team members, organized meetings, and ensured everyone was aware of their assigned tasks. This proactive approach contributed significantly to the overall success of the project.

In terms of technical skills, I acquired proficiency in following best security practices, including the implementation of parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks and generating random IDs for registration confirmation links. Additionally, I honed my Java skills and enhanced my strategies for automated testing, further bolstering the robustness and security of the project.

## Conclusion

Our web application streamlines BipSync's HR Department's onboarding processes, empowering efficient task management and teamwork. With features like secure access, privacy controls, email reminders, and a Kanban board, we enhance reliability while meeting immediate needs and fostering professional growth. Throughout this project, I developed leadership and teamwork skills, implemented security measures, and improved automated testing strategies, furthering my proficiency in software development.
